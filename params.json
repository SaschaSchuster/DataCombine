Please report any bugs at: <https://github.com/christophergandrud/DataCombine/issues>.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**DataCombine** is intended for making combining data sets--especially time-series cross-section data--easier. The package is in the very very early stages of development. It includes two functions:\r\n\r\n- `FillIn`: a function for filling in missing values of a variable from one data frame with the values from another variable.\r\n\r\n- `MoveFront`: a simple function for moving a variable to the front of a data frame. This can be useful if you have a data frame with many variables and just want to move one variable to the front.\r\n\r\n- `DropNA`: a function that drops rows from a data frame when they have missing (NA) values on a given variable(s).\r\n\r\nI will continue to add to the package as I build data sets and run across other pesky tasks I do repeatedly that would be simpler if they were turned into a function.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n**DataCombine** is in beta and so is not currently on CRAN. \r\n\r\nTo install the package use `install_github` from the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools):\r\n\r\n```\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"DataCombine\", \"christophergandrud\")\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
